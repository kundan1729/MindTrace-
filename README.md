## 🚀 How It Works

### Knowledge Graph Concept
- **Nodes** represent knowledge concepts (e.g., "Java Basics", "OOP Concepts")
- **Edges** represent connections between concepts with strength values
- **Strength Decay**: Connections automatically weaken by 5% every hour
- **Reinforcement**: Double-click edges to strengthen connections by 20 points

### Color Coding System
- **🟣 Purple**: Root nodes (nodes with no incoming connections)
- **🟢 Green**: Strong connections (70-100 strength)
- **🟡 Yellow**: Medium connections (30-69 strength)
- **🔴 Red**: Weak connections (0-29 strength)
